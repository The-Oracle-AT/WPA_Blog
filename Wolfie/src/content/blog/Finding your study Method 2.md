The road to become an A student isn’t just about studying, you must also keep your mind and body in the best shape it  can possibly be in.
#### Your Brain Wants to Have fun.
Study in ways that are fun for you. This keeps you positively motivated and you will not feel that studying is as much of a drag as it used to be (Some fun ways of studying include, playing your favorite music while you practice
solving equations, moving around the room while reading a book, acting out the characters roles
in a story you are reading, etc.).
#### Take sleep seriously.
1. __Memory consolidation.__
During sleep your brain consolidates and orders the information you’ve learned throughout the day. This helps information stored in our brains to move from short-term memory to long-term memory.
2. __Improved focus and attention.__
Getting enough rest allows you to concentrate and pay attention a lot better than when you
aren’t well rested. You are better off sleeping than trying to push yourself for little outcome.
3. __Emotional regulation.__
Sleep helps regulate emotions, hormones and reduces stress, anxiety and irritability. Having
control over your emotions and stability you will not be swayed by negative emotions as you will
have greater resilience.
4. __"Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together." - Thomas Dekker__
5. __Problem- solving and decision making__.
Sleep deprivation impairs judgement and promotes poor critical thinking ability. When you are
well rested you can make better decisions and think much more efficiently than when not
rested.

possible." - Richard P. Feynman</small><hr/>

#### Take Care of Your Body
1. To have and keep a healthy mind you must be in good health, because a healthy and optimized
mind requires a healthy and looked after body.
2. __Be mindful of what you eat.__
Other than the nutrition your body requires, your mind too is influenced by the food you eat.
Eating healthy promotes a healthy body and a healthy mind. Eating junk is fun and all but what
you do not realize is that a heavy junk-filled meal can make you feel sleepy and tired which
reduces your critical thinking capability and diminishes your concentration and attention.
3. __Exercise.__
4. __Don’t Force It.__ If you are unable to study and aren’t under any pressure to, don’t! You are better off having fun
and studying when nothing is holding you back.
Remove All Distractions
5. __Limit screen time__ – especially when you are about to sleep or stud.: Now more than ever we are bombarded with social media feeds and as fun as these short Tik-Tok videos are to watch, every time you visit Tik-Tok you are practicing how to limit you attention span to smaller time periods.
6. __Manage stress and anxiety__ – do not be swayed by negative emotions or thoughts. You must
have power over your mind and some control over the extent to which your emotions distract
you. (You may not be able to do this now, but anyone can gain control over their mental
facilities with practice)

It cannot be stressed enough how these small changes can enhance the quality of your life greatly. The internet and social media are powerful tools when leveraged properly. You can learn just about anything you can imagine. So instead of doom-scrolling learn a new skill or read about that topic you've been putting off.
