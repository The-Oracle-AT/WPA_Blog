We all need a role model or two. These are the people we often go to when we seek guidance or feeling down.

<h2>Why have a role model?</h2>
+ They show us that success is possible, and that we can achieve it too as a result we are willing to push further.
+ Their experiences and triumphs are an inspiration, especially when the going gets hard.
+ We draw courage from their stories.
+ They give us a sense of direction by being a guide to us.
+ With a sense of direction, comes a clear sense of purpose.

But if you've been with us long enough, you know by now that you must be question whether these are good enough reasons or whether the role model is even worth having.

<h2>Why We Do Not Aim to Be Our Role Models?</h2>

he thing about a role model is that they are like a limiter if you decide to pursue the tiresome task of trying to 
be like them. You may like and idolize your favorite musician, actor, TV personality, etc., but the thing is, you can 
never be your idol. There can only be one true Beyoncé or 
Michael Jackson, and it is extremely hard to try and replicate someone else's success. Imagine trying to be like Elon Musk, and you wish to have his life and his success.
You do not know what Elon went through to get what he has; you do not share the same experiences — even if you did,
it is not from the same perspective. Let me emphasize this further: you are not genetically built like Elon. So don't waste your time trying to make someone else's success story your success story.

But what you can do is aim for a more authentic goal and look to your idols for inspiration, aspiration, and guidance. 
Learn from the mistakes of those who came before you to get to your success with a bit more of a clear path than they 
had. Your role models are pioneers who reached success with a lot of unknowns in their paths; many share their stories, 
and there is something to be learned from what they have to say. We advise you to find a role model or two but do not 
try to be the person because that just beats the point of having one. You will limit yourself to becoming what you 
know about the person, and it is not enough anyway, so don't try.
