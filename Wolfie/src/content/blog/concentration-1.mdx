#### What Is Concentration
<p><i><small>"When you control your thoughts, you control your destiny"-Epictetus</small></i></p>

Concentraion is the power to redirect and focus one's attenmtion on a task- a single task.
Anyone who is ambitous about anything will know what it feels like to truly concentrate. Right now, we look at an extreme version of this, the highest form of concentraion, "The Zone."

**The Zone**<br></br>
A state of heightened mental focus and optimal performance that some athletes experience during their peak performance moments. It is often described as a state of single-mindedness because in "The Zone" they become one with the task, reaching a high level of concentraion and a sense of effortlessness while participating in the task at hand. To experience this, you would require all your mental and emotional faciliies to be directed to the task,
everything else becomes irrelevant. Let us explore the characterisics of this.

**Characterisics of "The Zone"**
+ __Total focus__: All attention is focused on one task and, distractions and external factors cease to exist, allowing the individual to concentrate on their performance.
+ __Effortlessness__: Automation of bodily functions and mind control to achieve the task. The body and the mind become one and execution of actions requires very little thought.
+ __Increased awareness__: The individual is aware of their surroundings and their physical and
emotional state. This allows them to easily adjust to any changes that may occur in "The Zone" to make split second decisions that would otherwise be difficult in a normal state of
concentraion.
+ __Emotional control__: Often the individual is composed and emotional turmoil that was there or arises is effortlessly eliminated as if it was never there, especially under high-pressure situations.
+ __Confidence__: The individual is sure of themselves; they have total confidence and unwavering belief in their abilities.

**Factors to consider for apex perfomance**:
+ __Clarity Of Goal__: Setting and having a clear goal during any task is a no brainer. Without knowing precisely what you want to achieve you will not be able to focus all your attention on what needs to be done to achieve this goal.
+ __Engaging Activity__: The activity must require the individual to exert themselves willingly or be enjoyable for the one doing it. A task that is not enjoyable, stressful, boring, tedious, etc. can hinder one's ability to reach apex perfomance or anything that is remotely close.
+ __Skill level__: Practice breeds perfecion, perfection is a prerequisite to becoming a high achiever in any discipline. Mozart would not be the great musician that we know if he did not pracice and perfect existing forms of music before raising the symphony, sonata, and opera to new heights.
+ __Autonomy__: There is a required sense of control and autonomy over one's actions. Having this enableâ€™s, the individual to make split second movements and/or decisions.
+ __Mental training__: Improved focus and visualizaion helps. The Will, the all-powerful tool to becoming better is what is needed to start anything or do anything that you may or may not like, without will you are a slave at the mercy of your mind.
Attaining such a powerful state of mind is not an easy task or one that you can simply decide to be in - it is a phenomena. It requires training and a lot of hard work - but even then it is not guaranteed to occur.
