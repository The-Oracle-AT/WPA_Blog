<h2>Choosing A Role Model</h2>

We do not often choose role models actively; they touch our hearts with their words or actions, and the next thing you know, they are a source of inspiration. But you can deliberately pick a role model of your choice (though after assessing whether they are the role model you want; everything happens as the former case.).

<h2>Types of Role Model Choices</h2>

+ <b>Path Related</b>: Choosing a role model based on the relation between your careers. Often a role model is chosen this way. 
This role model achieved a goal closely related to what you want to achieve, like a computer enthusiast having Bill Gates, 
Linus Torvalds, or Mark Zuckerberg as a role model, an aspiring professional soccer player having Messi as a role model, 
an aspiring rapper looking to J. Cole or A.K.A for inspiration. These are the easiest to pick.

+ <b>Goal Related</b>: These are role models we often get inspiration or words of wisdom from; they are often doing 
something different from what you want to achieve, but by listening to their story, you can relate or draw inspiration 
to pursue your goal. A good example would be a child drawing inspiration from a family member's struggle (usually parents).

+ <b>Unrelated</b>: This is that role model that you know you can never become, does nothing related to what you do 
yet when you look to them you cannot help but be moved. These role models are often based on fictional characters, 
like superheroes, supernatural beings, and princesses. These are often inspiration that can be drawn is limited only 
to the possesso's mind. This is the <b><i>Alter-Ego </i></b>origin.
