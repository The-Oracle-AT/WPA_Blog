This keeps you positively motivated and you will not feel that studying is as much of a drag as it used to be (Some fun ways of studying include, playing your favorite music while you practice\nsolving equations, moving around the room while reading a book, acting out the characters roles\nin a story you are reading, etc.).\n#### Take sleep seriously.\n1. __Memory consolidation.__ During sleep your brain consolidates and orders the information you’ve learned throughout the day. This helps information stored in our brains to move from short-term memory to long-term memory.\n2. __Improved focus and attention.__ Getting enough rest allows you to concentrate and pay attention a lot better than when you\naren’t well rested. You are better off sleeping than trying to push yourself for little outcome.\n3. __Emotional regulation.__\nSleep helps regulate emotions, hormones and reduces stress, anxiety and irritability. Having\ncontrol over your emotions and stability you will not be swayed by negative emotions as you will\nhave greater resilience.\n4. __\"Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.\" - Thomas Dekker__\n5. __Problem- solving and decision making__.\nSleep deprivation impairs judgement and promotes poor critical thinking ability. When you are\nwell rested you can make better decisions and think much more efficiently than when not\nrested.\n\n<p><small>\"Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.\" - Richard P. Feynman</small></p><br></br>\n\n<h2> Take Care of Your Body </h2>\n<p>To have and keep a healthy mind you must be in good health, because a healthy and optimized mind requires a healthy and looked after body.</p>\n\n<ol>\n    \n    <li> __Be mindful of what you eat.__\n    Other than the nutrition your body requires, your mind too is influenced by the food you eat.\n    Eating healthy promotes a healthy body and a healthy mind. Eating junk is fun and all but what\n    you do not realize is that a heavy junk-filled meal can make you feel sleepy and tired which\n    reduces your critical thinking capability and diminishes your concentration and attention.</li>\n    <li> __Exercise.__</li>\n    <li> __Don’t Force It.__ If you are unable to study and aren’t under any pressure to, don’t! You are better off having fun\n    and studying when nothing is holding you back.\n    Remove All Distractions</li>\n    <li> __Limit screen time__ – especially when you are about to sleep or study. Now more than ever we are bombarded with social media feeds and as fun as these short Tik-Tok videos are to watch, every time you visit Tik-Tok you are practicing how to limit you attention span to smaller time periods.</li>\n    <li> __Manage stress and anxiety__ – do not be swayed by negative emotions or thoughts. You must\n    have power over your mind and some control over the extent to which your emotions distract\n    you. (You may not be able to do this now, but anyone can gain control over their mental\n    facilities with practice) </li>\n</ol>\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough how these small changes can enhance the quality of your life greatly. The internet and social media are powerful tools when leveraged properly. You can learn just about anything you can imagine. So instead of doom-scrolling learn a new skill or read about that topic you've been putting off.\n<br></br><br></br><small>\"A sound mind in a sound body.\" – Aristotle</small>\n\n";
